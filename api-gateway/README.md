# API Gateway

This is the API Gateway of the Siome Project.

_An API gateway is **an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services**. An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result._

The application can be run using the following command.
### `mvn spring-boot:run`
